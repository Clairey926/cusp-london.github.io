The **Centre for Urban Science and Progress London (CUSP London)** is a joint initiative of King’s College
London and the University of Warwick. Its aim is to bring together researchers, businesses, local
authorities and government agencies to apply urban science to improving citizen’s lives, including
their health and wellbeing. The creation of CUSP London follows the highly successful establishment
of the Centre for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) in New York, and it is intended that the two 
units will work closely together.

In its activities, CUSP London will:

* Conduct fundamental and applied world leading research, in collaboration with its partners across its agreed technical scope
* Promote the highest level of skill and expertise in urban science
* Be multidisciplinary, transcending traditional discipline boundaries
* Offer masters-level courses both separately and potentially as an integrated part of a PhD programme
* Deliver research to the public through open access papers, open source code, and open data sets
* Enter into agreements with business, government, public and third-sector organisations to facilitate research
* Always act ethically and responsibly to benefit the common good
* Deliver research that is aligned with industry and commerce
