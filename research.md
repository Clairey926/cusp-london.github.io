### Overview

Like it’s sibling in New York, CUSP London is an interdisciplinary research and graduate-level teaching centre that uses London as both lab and classroom. We bring together researchers, policy-makers, and professionals to tackle urban challenges in the belief that cross-cutting, collaborative work is the best way to deliver solutions with real-word impact: the close involvement of our government and private sector partners allows CUSP London to translate research into action.

### What We Do

CUSP London’s expertise spans Computer Science, Computational Social Science and Health & Medicine.  Areas of particular interest include:

* Agent-based modelling of individuals, organisations, and their environment in a range of applied urban contexts (e.g. travel mode choice, neighbourhood change).
* AI-based reasoning in support of policy-development in urban applications such as hazards and resilience, security and conflict, and planning and regeneration (e.g. counter-terrorism, autonomous vehicles, and history-based personalisation for service users).
* Sensor network deployment and citizen science in challenging urban environments, including post-disaster and ‘low-tech’ contexts (e.g. air quality/pollution, resilient networks).
* Text-mining in support of healthcare data collection and analytics in urban areas (e.g. mental health, active travel).

These activities are underpinned by a commitment to transparency and openness with respect to how we develop and document analytical pipelines and results from end-to-end.
